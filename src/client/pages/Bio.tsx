        We are The Vinyl Birds, a blues rock duo from Newnan, Georgia. While we
        would mainly be considered "blues rock", we write and play anything we
        feel matches our aesthetic. This "umbrella" stretches from hill
        country/delta blues, early punk, 60's soul, all the way to softer folky
        acoustic ballads. It doesn't matter what we play, as long as it sounds
        like us.
